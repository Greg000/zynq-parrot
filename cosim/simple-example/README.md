- ps.cpp: user-written host code that interacts with accelerator device, both on FPGA and verilator cosimulation. 
  - interacts with both using a standard API:
    - void axil_write(int address, int data, int wstrb);
    - int axil_read(int address);
    - bool done(void);
- fpga: for running on the Zynq chip, using the ARM core (PS) talking to the PL (FPGA logic), which has the bit stream downloaded
- verilator: for simulating, uses the same AXI-lite verilog code as you use for the FPGA. Use this to debug and view waveforms with GTKWave before you run on FPGA and can't see what's going on easily!
